# RelayIt Documentation

**The unified notification API for developers.**

RelayIt abstracts the complexity of integrating with multiple communication providers, giving you a single, reliable endpoint to send notifications across all channels.

## What is RelayIt?

RelayIt is a notification relay service that enables developers to send messages across multiple channels through a unified API. Instead of integrating with multiple providers individually, you connect once to RelayIt and send messages to:

- **Email** (via AWS SES, SendGrid, and more)
- **SMS** (via AWS SNS, Twilio, and more) 
- **WhatsApp** (via WhatsApp Business API)
- **Discord** (via Discord Bot API)

## Key Features

- **üöÄ Unified API** - One endpoint for all your notification needs
- **‚ö° Queue Management** - Built-in Redis-based queuing and retry logic
- **üîí Secure** - Your provider credentials are encrypted and securely stored
- **üìä Tracking** - Real-time status tracking and webhook notifications
- **üåç Multi-tenant** - Organization and project-based isolation
